							<p><b><u>Team Members:</u></b> 
								Pek Yong, Elena, Xaiver Tan and Yu Quan</p>
							<p><b><u>Background:</u></b> <br> 
								Food security is an important aspect in Singapore’s “30 by 30” goal to sustainably produce 30% of the nation’s nutritional needs. One of the ways to achieve this is to support food 
								agriculture in Singapore households. Encouraging Singaporean Citizens to grow albeit, a tiny amount of food, in their own household, can cause a ripple effect which can lead to a 
								substantial amount in reducing the strain on Singapore reliance of food importation. However, one caveat is that plants take a relatively long time to bear fruit. 
							</p>
						
							<p><b><u>Problem Statement:</u></b> <br> 
								How might we design an off-grid plant growing system to promote growth of plant by lengthening the amount of time for the plant to undergo photosynthesis?  
							</p>

							<p><b><u>Our Solution:</u></b> <br> 
								Our team have integrated solar panels, a battery system and LED growth light onto a small table. The solar panel will charge the battery during the day, and the growth light
								will switch on when the illumination is below a certain level. It is estimated to provide around 4 additional hours of photosynthesis time to promote growth, before letting the plant
								"rest" for the rest of the night.  						
							</p>

							<p><b><u>Future Improvements:</u></b> <br> 
								Here are the following improvements we hope to make:
								<ul>
									<li>To improve the effiency, we going to integrate a voltage bulk converter to step the 12V from solar panel to 5V, which is the voltage rating of the growth light. </li>
									<li>Change the battery from lead-acid to lithum-based battery, as it have a higher specific energy.</li>
									<li>Increase the capacity of the battery to cater a higher day of autonomy</li>
									<li>Increase solar panel wattage to cater to months of low sunlight</li>
									<li>Integrate auto watering system to make it more convinent</li>
								</ul>
